Weekly Computer Club

In here will be all the projects and work created by an eager team of students developing their programming skills in Python 2.7

These mini-projects will build towards the skills necessary to complete a project in school to link a touch sensitive chess board to our Raspberry-pi. This will enable chess pieces to be moved around the display by using the touch interface. Eventually we will try and connect the movements to an existing AI chess program.
